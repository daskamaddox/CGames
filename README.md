## Summary

### User story
I want a way to learn a programming language that is fun and feels like
playing a game.

### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
We want the user to be able to press a button and then enter a game where
questions are asked regarding different python coding concepts. The user is
rewarded for correct answers and can proceed to the next part of the game upon
meeting a minimum point requirement. We want to incorporate a global
leaderboard so the user can compare scores with other users.

### Add-on features
1. Globe feature where each continent represents a different concept in Python
and each major city is a level. The user must visit every connecting city to
"beat" the continent and progress to the next one.
2. Incorporate more programming languages -- at first, our web app will only
give the option to learn one programming language (Python), additional
languages could be added to the web app later.
3. Ability to share a highscore to a social media account.

## Testing
```
$ git clone https://github.com/briankarUB/CGames.git
$ cd CGames
$ python setup.py validate
```

## Running
Follow the above procedure to clone and test the project. Then, modify 
`config.py` to include your own Google API authentication info, which you
can get from https://console.cloud.google.com.

Finally, run the project using the following command:
```
python -m cgames.run
```
